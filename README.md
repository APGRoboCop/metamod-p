What is special in this version of metamod?
-------
- Hardcoded linkents have been replaced with dynamic linkents. No large list of entities that get outdated fast as new mods come and old ones update.
- Autodetects gamedll for unknown/new mods (so you don't have to use metamod-config to make Metamod-P work on those mods).
- Because of reasons above, you basicly never need to update metamod again anymore. This works all future mods and updates.
- Better performance/less CPU usage than original Metamod (by reducing executable size and therefore CPU cache pressure).
